.SH HOW TO MOVE CARDS
.PP                                        
CPat is laid out with the general playing board in the centre of the screen. 
Each column on the main board is labelled with a letter starting at 'a' 
going up to the number of columns in the particular game you are playing. 
Most of the games have foundation piles and these are placed in a board on the 
left side of the screen. These piles are labelled 'p' for foundation 
[p]iles. On the right hand side there is usually another board which is used 
for different purposes depending on the game. This is labelled 'o' for [o]ther.
.PP                                        
Most move commands consist of a 2 character sequence proceeded by an 
optional number. 
The first character denotes the source card and the second the 
destination pile. For example 'ad' moves the bottom card from column 'a' 
onto column 'd', 'bp' moves the bottom card from column 'b' onto the 
appropriate foundation pile (depending on its suit).
.PP                                        
In general, a number is included in the command to signify the number of 
cards to move when moving a stack or sequence of cards. 
For example, '3bf' will move a stack of 3 cards from column 'b' to 'f'. 
The type of stacks 
you are allowed to move depends on the game you are playing. 
.PP
The 'o' command is used to manipulate cards on the "other" board. This 
will depend on the game you are playing. In Klondike type games where 
there is a deck of cards to look through, two 'o' characters will turn
cards over onto the waste pile and an 'o' followed by another letter will 
move a card off the waste pile. In Freecell type games, the "other" board 
contains the freecells and cards can be moved to and from these piles in the 
normal way, however when moving a card from the freecells a number is 
required to designate which card you want to move.
.PP                                        
Cards can also be moved 
to the foundation piles automatically. To do this you use only the 
letter 'p'. Two 'p' characters will move one card (or pile depending on 
the game being played) to the foundation. If the 'pp' is proceeded by 
a number, a maximum of that many cards (piles) will be moved at once. 
A capital 'P' will move as many 
cards (piles) as possible. There is no particular order 
to the way the cards are moved.
